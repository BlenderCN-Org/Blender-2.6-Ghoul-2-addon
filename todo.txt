* model fromBlender
* model export option: strip texture paths (force .skin)
* smoothing (optional?)
* Test
  * "*default" skeleton glm
  * gla override with invalid skeleton
  * in general all kinds of invalid input
* sort out MdxaHeader.fScale - I need it during import (yet it seems to be ignored by ModView) so I'll have to use it on export, too.
* fix obvious animation exporting bugs (exported animation is obviously flawed) - probably mostly (completely?) related to scale stuff (?)
